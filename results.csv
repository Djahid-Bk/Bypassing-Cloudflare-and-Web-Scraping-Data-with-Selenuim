У нас на курсе, люди зачастую первый раз открывают Unreal Engine, а уходят с качественными кейсами в портфолио. Мы занимаемся обучением специалистов из области CG аж с 2014 года. В своем обучении, используем комплексный подход, который позволяет закрыть все ""белые пятна"" в знаниях специалистов. Наша цель — не просто показать на какие кнопочки ""тыкать"", а пройти весь пайплайн вместе с учеником. Рассказать основы операторской (и не только) работы, ведь синематики - это не просто накидал готовых ассетов в сцену! Совместно с командой мы продвигаем и поддерживаем пожалуй самое большое CGI комьюнити в России и СНГ. ---------------------------------- JCenterS — we teach you how to make cinematics from scratch. In our course, people often open Unreal Engine for the first time, and leave with high-quality cases in their portfolio. We have been training CG specialists since 2014. In our training, we use an integrated approach that allows us to close all the ""white spots"" in the knowledge of specialists. Our goal is not just to show which buttons to ""poke"", but to go through the entire pipeline with the student. Tell the basics of camerawork (and not only), because cinematics is not just throwing ready-made assets into the scene! Together with the team, we promote and support perhaps the largest CGI community in Russia and the CIS.",https://www.artstation.com/jcentersschool/profile
